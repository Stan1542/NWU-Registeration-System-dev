North-West University Registration System
A web application is required for our university's student registration system, targeting second-year information system
students for the next academic year. The application enables students to update their biographical information and validates
their eligibility to progress based on core module completion. Two programs, Extended Information Systems and
Mainstream, are supported. While the system features a demo payment gateway, it lacks a fully functional payment system.
Students can obtain a proof of registration after successful registration. The system allows login, logout, and signup
functionality for students.
