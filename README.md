# North-West University Registration System

## Project Overview

This web application serves as the student registration system for the North-West University, specifically targeting second-year information system students for the upcoming academic year. The primary functionalities include updating biographical information, validating eligibility for progression based on core module completion, and supporting two programs: Extended Information Systems and Mainstream. While the system integrates a demo payment gateway, it is important to note that a fully functional payment system is not yet implemented. Upon successful registration, students can obtain a proof of registration. The system also features essential user interactions such as login, logout, and signup.

## Key Features

- **Biographical Information Update:** Students can easily update their personal information through the application.

- **Eligibility Validation:** The system validates students' eligibility to progress based on the completion of core modules.

- **Program Support:** Two programs, Extended Information Systems and Mainstream, are supported within the registration system.

- **Demo Payment Gateway:** Although a fully functional payment system is pending, the application showcases a demo payment gateway.

- **Proof of Registration:** Upon successful registration, students can obtain a proof of registration for their records.

- **User Authentication:** The system incorporates essential user authentication features, including login, logout, and signup functionality for students.

## Technologies Used

- **PHP:** Data retrieval and storage in the database are achieved using PHP, demonstrating the practical application of server-side scripting.

- **JavaScript:** The project explores the use of JavaScript, particularly focusing on nested if statements for complex logic and leveraging JavaScript to influence HTML elements dynamically.

## Learning Highlights

This project has provided valuable insights into database interactions using PHP for data retrieval and storage. Additionally, JavaScript's role in handling complex logic, particularly through nested if statements, has been a key learning point. The practical application of JavaScript influencing HTML elements enhances the understanding of dynamic web development.

## Future Development

- **Payment System Implementation:** Future iterations of the project can focus on the full integration of a functional payment system for a comprehensive registration experience.

- **Enhanced User Interface:** Improving the user interface for a more intuitive and user-friendly experience can be a potential area of future development.

Feel free to explore the project code to gain insights into PHP and JavaScript integration, database operations, and user authentication features. For any inquiries or feedback, please contact the project contributors.
